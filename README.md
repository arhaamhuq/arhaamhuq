### Welcome to my README 🥳

## About me

Hi, I'm _Arhaam_. I'm currently a student at Colby College and have just begun my programming journey learning Python in order to manipulate textual data using natural language processing.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on attempting to familiarise myself with the basics of Python as well as github and codespaces. While it is quite confusing, I find it very engaging to run into different problems and then attempting to find their solutions.
- 🔎 I am currently very interested in delving into the programming world as in the contemporary world it is one of the most useful skills to have!
- 🏎 My favorite hobby is **driving**
